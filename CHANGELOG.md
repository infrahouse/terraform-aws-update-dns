  - Resolves issue where orphaned DNS records remained in Route53 after manual instance termination
  - Adds integration test `test_dns_record_deletion_on_manual_termination` to verify proper DNS cleanup
- Update test suite to use pytest-infrahouse subzone fixture
- Replace test_zone data source lookup with direct zone_id variable

### Refactor
